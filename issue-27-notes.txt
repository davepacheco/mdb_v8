status:
- see "changes", TODO below
- test suite passes all Node versions, both 32-bit and 64-bit
- XXX test suite now uses various modules that need to go into devDependencies
  and build needs to "npm install" them
- see XXXs
- update the other tests that use gcore to use my new mechanism
- memory leak test
  - add it to the common test suite code?
- update copyrights

changes:
- changed internal representation of arrays to better support large arrays
- update jsprint to use this (still sucks because of the way jsprint works)
- update v8array to use this (not much difference?)
- **no longer print lots of "hole" values on the end of long arrays**
- add "::jsarray" command
- generalize test suite common code for use in more places
