 * mdb_v8_dbg.h: interface for working with V8 objects in a debugger.
 *
 * This file should contain types and functions useful for debugging Node.js
 * programs.  These functions may currently be implemented in terms of the MDB
 * module API, but this interface should not include any MDB-specific
 * functionality.  The expectation is that this could be implemented by another
 * backend, and that it could be used to implement a different user interface.
 *
 * Addresses in the target program are represented as "uintptr_t".  Most of
 * these are either V8 small integers (see V8_IS_SMI() and V8_SMI_VALUE()) or
 * other V8 heap objects.  A number of functions exists to inspect and dump
 * these, but they have not yet been abstracted here.
 *
 *
 * RETURN VALUES
 *
 * Functions here fall into one of two categories: functions that return "int"
 * (or a pointer that may be NULL) can generally fail because of a validation
 * problem or a failure to read information from the target's address space.
 * Other functions cannot fail because it's assumed that whatever conditions
 * they depend on have already been validated.  They typically assert such
 * conditions.  It's critical that such conditions _have_ already been checked
 * (e.g., in v8context_load() or by the caller).  The debugger should not assume
 * that the target's address space is not arbitrarily corrupt.
 *
 *
 * USAGE PATTERNS
 *
 * Most of the objects below have a few common patterns of functions:
 *
 *     CLASSNAME_t *CLASSNAME_load(uintptr_t addr, int memflags)
 *
 *         Given an address in the target program "addr" and memory allocation
 *         flags "memflags", validate that the address refers to an object of
 *         the appropriate class, load basic information about the object, and
 *         return a handle for working with it.
 *
 *         For example, v8function_load() takes a pointer to a JSFunction object
 *         in the target program, validates it, and loads pointers to the
 *         function's name, JavaScript source code, and so on.  Once you've
 *         loaded an object like this, most other functions will not fail,
 *         because they've already validated the things that can go wrong.
 *
 *     void CLASSNAME_free(CLASSNAME_t *)
 *
 *         Frees an object of type CLASSNAME, if appropriate.  Note that the
 *         memflags specified when the object was loaded may specify that the
 *         object should be GC'd later, in which case this will do nothing, but
 *         in general callers should not assume this unless they were the ones
 *         that called CLASSNAME_load() in the first place.
 *
 *     uintptr_t CLASSNAME_addr(CLASSNAME_t *);
 *
 *         Returns the address in the target process for this object (as
 *         initially passed to CLASSNAME_load()).
 *
 * There are a few other patterns used here:
 *
 *     CLASSNAME2_t *CLASSNAME1_CLASSNAME2(CLASSNAME1_t *);
 *
 *         This is used when objects of one class refer to objects of another.
 *         For example, every v8function_t refers to a v8funcinfo_t with shared
 *         function information.  Given a v8function_t, you can get to the
 *         v8funcinfo_t using v8function_funcinfo().

/*
 * Functions, contexts, closures, and ScopeInfo objects
 *
 * Each JavaScript closure (an instance of the V8 "JSFunction" class) has its
 * own Context (another V8 heap object).  The Context contains values of
 * variables that are accessible from that context.  By looking at the Context
 * associated with a closure, we can see the values of variables accessible in
 * that closure.  (Contexts are also used for other facilities, like "with"
 * expressions, but there is no support here for dealing with other kinds of
 * Contexts.)
 *
 * The information about the layout of a Context is stored in a separate
 * ScopeInfo object.  The ScopeInfo describes, among other things, the names of
 * the variables accessible in that context.  All closures for a given function
 * (in the JavaScript source code) share the same ScopeInfo, and that ScopeInfo
 * is available on the SharedFunctionInfo object referenced by each JSFunction
 * object.  (This makes sense because all closures for a given function (in the
 * source code) share the same set of accessible variable names.)
 *
 * ScopeInfo objects also include information about parameters and stack-local
 * variables, but the values of these are not available from a Contexts.
 *
 * In order to commonize code around reading and validating context information,
 * we require that callers use v8context_load() in order to work with Contexts.
 * Similarly, we provide v8scopeinfo_load() in order to work with ScopeInfo
 * objects.  As a convenient special case, we provide v8context_scopeinfo() to
 * load a scopeinfo_t for a v8context_t.
 *
 * Inside V8, both Context and ScopeInfo objects are implemented as FixedArrays.
 * Both have a few statically-defined slots that describe the object, followed
 * by dynamic slots.  For Contexts, the dynamic slots are described by the
 * corresponding ScopeInfo.  For ScopeInfo objects, the dynamic slots are
 * described by the initial statically-defined slots.
 *
 * For more on Context internals, see src/context.h in the V8 source.  For more
 * information on ScopeInfo internals, see the declaration of the ScopeInfo
 * class in src/objects.h in the V8 source.
